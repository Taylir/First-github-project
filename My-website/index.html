            I am starting my journey on 7/28 of 2022, sadly will be taking a
            vacation just after making this and my learning time will be
            squandered but, this is the beggining and I can see where I will come
            from this point and the button will help me keep track. As I gget
            better the button will take me to the different times and sections of
            my coding life, as of this date though it will just be a button foor
            design purposes. I look forward to see where this will go!

            7/29/2022: Update: Just learned about flexbox and that sounds much
            easier to do to align the liks in the top right. Using display:flex; I
            should be able to do exactly that with out having to do position
            absolute and relative and all of that lets see how it turns out!
          </p>

            8/2/2022: Got back from vacation and ready to continue learning I am
            thinking of making a webpage for everything I learn. Yes it will be a
            lot it will be tedious but doing so will let me have countless notes
            as well as have been doing them each over and over in different ways.
            Putting a goal with each different tool so I can uderstand and use it
            better for myself.
