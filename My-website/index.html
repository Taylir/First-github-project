          Welcome to the begining of my website creations enjoy the ride and
          lets see where this goes!

        <p>
          I am starting my journey on 7/28 of 2022, sadly will be taking a
          vacation just after making this and my learning time will be
          squandered but, this is the beggining and I can see where I will come
          from this point and the button will help me keep track. As I gget
          better the button will take me to the different times and sections of
          my coding life, as of this date though it will just be a button foor
          design purposes. I look forward to see where this will go!

          7/29/2022: Update: Just learned about flexbox and that sounds much
          easier to do to align the liks in the top right. Using display:flex; I
          should be able to do exactly that with out having to do position
          absolute and relative and all of that lets see how it turns out!
