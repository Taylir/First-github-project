          I am starting my journey on 7/28 of 2022,this is the beggining and I
          can see where I will come from this point and the button will help me
          keep track. As I gget better the button will take me to the different
          times and sections of my coding life, as of this date though it will
          just be a button for design purposes. I look forward to seeing where
          this will go!
        </p>

          7/29/2022: Update: Just learned about flexbox and that sounds much
          easier to do to align the liks in the top right. Using display:flex; I
          should be able to do exactly that with out having to do position
          absolute and relative and all of that lets see how it turns out!
        </p>

        <p>
          8/2/2022: seeing what I will have to do this week will more so just be
          trying my best to rememebr what everything does. As it is just
          learning the language and remembering where and when to use the
          certain codes.
        </p>

        <p>
          8/3/2022: Today added an HTML page for projects to connect you to.
          That way that actually works Currently the only one taking you some
          where is projects. More will come..
        </p>
        <p>
          8/4/2022: Added Some HTML Notes and such trying to figure out the best
          basic and most used ones to add on to it. List will continue to grow
          as my knowledge grows.
        </p>
        <p>
          8/5/2022: Started to add some CSS to the notes page so that I can
          better unbderstand how it all work together and get it working better.
          I think the future CSS notes page will probably be better.
        </p>
        <p>
          8/6/2022: Css is fully done in the HTML page there was not to much but
          getting it to look acceptable was the challanging part. Will probably
          be able to orgasinze it better in the future, right now though it will
          have to be good enough as I just do not have the expericne to make it
          beautiful.
        </p>
        <p>
          8/8/2022: Going to be adding that CSS Note page today and it will
          probably be much more work and a lot more information in this one as
          there are far more possible inputs to use and much more language you
          need to know to fully understand.
