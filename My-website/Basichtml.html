            Here notes are kept about different HTML codes I have learned so far and
            will be updated often. Both in style as I get better and in more
            information.

            <p> Very little css will be used in this but it will be mentioned where and what was changed to better
                understand what goes into all of it. (CSS went into this to center it and bold it)</p>

                        (h1-h6): Using h1 - h6 is normally used for headers of some sort
                        typically. Most of the time h1-h3 is used as h4 - h6 start to get
                        to small when you continue on so h1-h3 is the most and commonly
                        used due to this. Considering these are mainly used speciafically for headers or headings you
                        normally want them a bit bigger than your average text.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <h1>H1</h1>

                    <p>
                        (nav): Used first and typically at the top as a way to label that
                        the nav bar is located here. Having a logo and links taking you to
                        your website is normally what goes here. Mainly used for just the
                        tag so it is easier to find you can also use it if you have
                        another bar you are wanting to redirect people just a way to label
                        and keep track that there are navigations in this section. (Css was used here to orgasinze and
                        color the lettering in order to make it show and file in this order, very basic.)
                        With out CSS in this situation it would just be a regular bullet point
                        list going from top to bottom.
                    <nav id="exnav">
                        <ul>
                            <li> <a href="#">Money Tree</a></li>
                        </ul>
                        <ul>
                            <li> <a href="#">Money Tree</a></li>
                        </ul>
                        <ul>
                            <li> <a href="#">Money Tree</a></li>
                        </ul>
                        <ul>
                            <li> <a href="#">Money Tree</a></li>
                        </ul>
                    </nav>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        (p): This is used for general writing of whatever really. All of
                        these notes are put into a p label as they are long and not used
                        as a heading so they will fall under the p label and will mainly
                        just be paragraph.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        (section): Section is used to seperate well sections. If you have
                        one area talking about one thing or a topic or a list. You would
                        use a section label when wanting to start a new one and to
                        seperate it from the last.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        (div): Div is used to help seperate other lables that do not
                        automatically seperate as well as being able to label them easier
                        since you sometimes want certain CSS effects on other pieces but
                        not all of them.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        (ID & Class): These are used withing each of the other labels to
                        help create certain classes so that you can design and decerate
                        certain parts of the webpage to make it look better. Basically
                        creating a call to those certain areas for CSS.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        (ul & ol): These labels are meant to make un-organized lists and
                        organized lists (ul & ol respectivley) so that you can make things
                        in a more listed format. The main difference is that Ul is more of
                        just a random listing in any order while an ol is a very organized
                        top to bottom ordered list.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                (li): For these lists items you want to seperate them with li
                                creating each item in said list as a listed item.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        (Header & footer): Header is used typically first or right after the
                        Nav depending on your page layout but you want this to be at the top
                        as header kind of suggests. And oppisite with footer as you want this
                        to be just about very last outside of body unlike any other label but
                        just before the HTML label at the end, Footer will typically be all
                        by istelf at the very end.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        (a): a is used as an anchor for links, typically followed by the keyword href, will allow links
                        to be ancorhed in and allowing the work form or whatever you may chose to be clicked and taken
                        to said link.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        (button): A very simple to understand but the practicle use of it it is more difficult. Creats a
                        button on a page but in most cases will be used by putting button in a form in order to actually
                        allow it to take you to a link.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <button>I'm a button that does nothing written with the button label</button>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        (form): Form is a very powerful and very used label in almost every webpage. It may be more
                        hidden or you may not realize what is actually using the form tag but it helps creat a section
                        for making a form and allowing it enter credetials for emails and names and anything else
                        really.(Css added to the bottom form to make it a bit more organized and less ugly, the first
                        form has no css added to it. Mainly just to see how ugly forms are by default.)
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                (label): In forms this is used to label the following input such as username: or
                                like Email:.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                (input): This one can be used to specify exactly what input we are wanting, such as
                                specifically and email or specifically a username to help push the user in the right direction.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <form>
                                <div>
                                    <label for="name">Name</label>
                                    <input type="text" name="name">

                                <div>
                                    <label for="email">Email</label>
                                    <input type="email" name="">
                                </div>
                                <div>
                                    <label for="message">Message</label>

                        the HTML. Such as the Iron Giant in the top left was inputted into the early nav bar. While this
                        is a very useful label it is in no means needed to make a website but more a helpful tool.
